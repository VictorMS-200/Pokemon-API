## Fist of all
This project was made with the purpose of learning how to use the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/), and the [Asp.Net Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/?view=aspnetcore-5.0) framework. For this reason, it is not a complete project, and it is not intended to be used in production, just for learning purposes.

## How to use?

You need to have the .NET SDK installed on your machine. You can download it <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0">here</a>. After that, you can clone this repository and run the projects in your IDE. I recommend using Visual Studio Code or Visual Studio Community.

After cloning the repository, you need to install the dependencies. To do this, you need to run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Razor.RuntimeCompilation --version 7.0.9
```

After that, you can run the projects using the following command in the terminal and run the following command:

```bash
dotnet run
```

If you want to run with hot reload (the server will restart automatically when you change the code), you can run the following command (you need to have the dotnet watch tool installed):

```bash
dotnet watch run
```
