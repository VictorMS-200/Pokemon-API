## Fist of all
This project was made with the purpose of learning how to use the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/), and the [Asp.Net Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/?view=aspnetcore-5.0) framework. For this reason, it is not a complete project, and it is not intended to be used in production, just for learning purposes.

## How to use?

First of all you need to have the .NET SDK installed on your machine. You can download it <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0">here</a>. After that, you can clone this repository and run the projects in your IDE. I recommend using Visual Studio Code or Visual Studio Community.

After cloning the repository, you can run the projects using the following command in the terminal and run the following command:

```bash
dotnet run
```
